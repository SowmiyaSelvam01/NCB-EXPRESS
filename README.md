# Detailed Problem description

#### India lies sandwiched between two of the world‚Äôs ‚Äúthree key production areas‚Äù for opium, leading to an illicit drugs crisis. But cross-border trafficking holds only part of the explanation for the illicit drugs trade that runs through India. India‚Äôs pharmaceutical industry is ‚Äúthe largest provider of generic drugs globally‚Äù, as per the department of pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. But there have been reports of clandestine manufacturing and siphoning of synthetic drugs, as well as illicit trade in chemical precursors.

#### Currently there is no digital way of reporting drug trafficking. The only way is to reach out Narcotics squad or nearby police station. However, this is not feasible since majority of public will not be ready to disclose their profile or will not be ready to spend their time physically. The intended solution should enable public to report the findings of drug trafficking in their locality anonymously. If the system is anonymous there could be possibility of large number of false alarms, and some can be intentional too. Hence the solution should enable filtering out the false alarms by employing any kind of machine learning models. The solution should enable the public to upload any relevant information about the finding and it should be easy for the user to use with different language. supports.
